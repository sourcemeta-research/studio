Publisher & Verification Status
-------------------------------

Sourcemeta Studio is published and maintained by the **official Sourcemeta
organization**, the team behind open-source JSON Schema tooling used in
production by developers and companies worldwide.

At the time of writing, the Visual Studio Code Marketplace **Verified Publisher**
badge has not yet been applied to this extension. Publisher verification is a
Microsoft-managed, administrative process that is independent of an
extension’s code quality, security posture, or maintenance status, and can take
time even for established open-source organizations.

This extension is actively maintained by the Sourcemeta team, and all releases
are built from the same public repositories that power Sourcemeta’s other
open-source projects.
